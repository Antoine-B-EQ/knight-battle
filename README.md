# knight-battle

Bravely fight against 12 ennemies.
Each ennemy has special power.
* The orc uses a club.
* The hydra can grow a new head every round.
* The mold can immobilize you.
* The brigand will weaken you, taking away your health, agility or strength.


Planning to add more ennemies in the future.
